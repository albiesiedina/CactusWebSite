# CactusWebSite
Welcome to one of my small projects. Here you can get familiar with how I write code and what I can do

# What I use
This project uses ***HTML*** to set up each page and ***CSS*** to style it.

# Note
Thanks for taking time and looking through my project. I'm always open to feedback, so if you have some feel free to ping me.
